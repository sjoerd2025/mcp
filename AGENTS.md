# AGENTS.md

## Project overview

`cloudflare-mcp` is a token-efficient Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes the entire Cloudflare API (~2,500 endpoints) using Cloudflare's **Code Mode** pattern. Instead of registering thousands of MCP tools, it uses just two tools (`search` and `execute`) that let agents write JavaScript to query the OpenAPI spec and call APIs — fitting all 2,500 endpoints into ~1,000 tokens.

**Production URL:** `mcp.cloudflare.com`

## MCP specification compliance

When modifying MCP or OAuth functionality, **always check the latest published MCP specification**:

- **Specification:** https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28
- **Authorization section:** https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/basic/authorization

## Code standards

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- Target: ES2022, Module: ESNext
- Runtime validation with Zod for auth props and external data

### Formatting & linting

- **oxfmt** for formatting: single quotes, no semicolons, no trailing commas
- **oxlint** for linting
- Run `npm run format` before committing

### Naming conventions

- `PascalCase` for classes, interfaces, types, enums
- `camelCase` for functions, methods, variables
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

## Architecture

### Two-tool Code Mode pattern

The core innovation: instead of 2,500 MCP tools (~244K tokens), two tools handle everything:

1. **`search` tool** — Agents write JavaScript to query the pre-resolved OpenAPI spec (all `$ref`s inlined). Runs in an isolated worker with no network access.
2. **`execute` tool** — Agents write JavaScript using `cloudflare.request()` to call discovered endpoints. Runs in an isolated worker with outbound restricted to Cloudflare API URLs only.

### MCP HTTP serving

- `src/mcp-handler.ts` uses `createMcpHandler(factory)` directly from `@modelcontextprotocol/server`; this repository does not depend on the Agents SDK.
- Each authenticated request creates an upstream handler whose factory closes over validated `AuthProps`, matching the repository's pre-migration explicit data flow.
- The handler serves MCP `2026-07-28` and keeps the upstream default stateless 2025 compatibility path. Its factory creates a fresh `McpServer` for every request.
- No MCP session ID, protocol transport state, replay store, Durable Object, or Node async-context bridge is used.
- Deployment-static Host and browser Origin allowlists cover localhost, staging, and production. Do not derive either trust list from the incoming request URL or headers.

### Worker Loader API

Code execution uses Cloudflare's Worker Loader API to dynamically create isolated worker instances. The API token is passed via props (never enters user code isolate). A `globalOutbound` service restricts network access.

### Authentication

Two credential paths produce the same Zod-validated `AuthProps` union:

- **OAuth mode** (default): `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` validates its own access tokens and restores encrypted Cloudflare OAuth props. The upstream authorization-code and refresh flows use PKCE and remain separate from direct credential resolution.
- **Direct Cloudflare credential mode**: after the provider's internal lookup misses, `resolveExternalToken` validates the bearer against the Cloudflare API and returns request-local props. Prefixes are owner hints: `cfat_` account tokens query only `/accounts`; `cfut_` user API tokens and `cfoat_` Cloudflare OAuth credentials query `/user` and `/accounts`; unprefixed legacy tokens retain response-based inference. Expected failures use the provider's `ExternalTokenError`, which generates RFC 6750/9728 `401`/`403` challenges and preserves retry guidance.

Validated direct-credential identity is cached by token hash in `OAUTH_KV`; provider-issued MCP tokens never invoke the external resolver.

The consent picker uses the production catalog returned by `GET /oauth/scopes` in every deployment. Staging may register additional scopes, but the MCP picker exposes them only after they reach production. Only the user, account, and offline-access OAuth bootstrap scopes sit outside the API catalog. Terraform registration must land before deploying picker additions. The app does not impose a scope-count cap.

### OpenAPI spec processing

- Fetched from GitHub daily (scheduled handler, cron `0 0 * * *`)
- All `$ref` references resolved inline before storage
- Products and minimal operation metadata extracted
- Stored in R2 bucket (`SPEC_BUCKET`) as `spec.json`, `products.json`, and the precomputed `non-codemode-tools.json` artifact
- The non-Code-Mode artifact contains protocol-ready JSON Schemas plus minimal request-routing metadata. Low-level MCP handlers serve `tools/list` directly and lazily validate/dispatch only the requested `tools/call` operation with Zod; no per-endpoint SDK tools are registered
- `src/isolate-cache.ts` caches all three artifacts for one hour in warm isolates; non-Code-Mode falls back to deriving its artifact from `spec.json` during rollout

### Response truncation

Responses capped at ~6,000 tokens (~24KB). Truncation notice included with original size to prompt agents to write more specific queries.

### Usage metrics (Analytics Engine)

Tool usage is tracked via the `MCP_METRICS` Analytics Engine binding into the shared `mcp-metrics-{dev,staging,production}` dataset — the same dataset used by the per-product Cloudflare MCP servers (`cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare`), so this server shows up alongside them under server name `cloudflare-api`.

- `src/metrics.ts` mirrors the upstream `@repo/mcp-observability` schema. The blob/double layout is **positional and must not change**: `index1` = event type, `blob1`/`blob2` = server name/version (reserved), `blob3` = userId, `blob4` = toolName/errorMessage, `double1` = errorCode.
- `attachMetrics()` in `src/server.ts` wraps Code-Mode `registerTool` calls; the lazy non-Code-Mode dispatcher records the same `tool_call` events directly. `auth_user` events are emitted from the OAuth handler.
- **No `session_start`**: MCP `2026-07-28` has no protocol sessions or `initialize` handshake. The 2025 compatibility path also creates a fresh server for each request and retains no initialization state. Client identity remains visible at the HTTP layer through `User-Agent` (including zone HTTP analytics).
- The tracker is tolerant of a missing binding (no-op in tests/local dev) and swallows write errors so metrics can never break a tool call.
- Query via the Analytics Engine SQL API: `SELECT ... FROM 'mcp-metrics-production' WHERE blob1='cloudflare-api' AND index1='tool_call'`.

## Security considerations

- API tokens never enter user code isolates — passed via worker props
- `globalOutbound` service restricts execute tool to Cloudflare API URLs only
- Search tool runs with no network access
- OAuth uses PKCE (RFC 7636) for secure authorization
- Cookie encryption for OAuth sessions (`MCP_COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
- The `/mcp` route validates Host and present browser Origin headers against deployment-static allowlists before authentication

## Testing

Tests live in the top-level `tests/` directory (mirroring `src/`) and use **vitest** with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`.

```bash
npm run test          # Single run
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
```

**Unit/integration coverage areas:**

- Scheduled handler (spec fetching & processing)
- Auth token detection and parsing
- Auth props building and validation
- Spec processor ($ref resolution, product extraction)
- Response truncation
- Metrics event mapping & path normalization

**End-to-end (`tests/e2e/`):**
Drives the real worker via `exports.default.fetch()` (from `cloudflare:workers`), the
pattern from the [Cloudflare vitest recipes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/recipes/).
A full JSON-RPC `tools/call` for `execute` runs real code inside a Worker Loader
isolate and is forwarded through the real `GlobalOutbound` proxy. The **only** mock
is outbound `fetch()`, declared with **MSW** (`server.use(http.get(...))`) — see
`tests/e2e/msw-server.ts` and `tests/e2e/msw-setup.ts`. MSW intercepts both the
auth-guard `/user`+`/accounts` probes and the GlobalOutbound-forwarded API call.
Everything else — auth, MCP transport, tool dispatch, Worker Loader — is the real
code path.

The test stack is **vitest 4 + `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.16** using the
`cloudflareTest()` Vite plugin (required for MSW's `msw/node` to load under
workerd). Note: storage isolation is per test **file** (not per test), so tests
sharing real bindings (e.g. `OAUTH_KV`) must clear state in `afterEach`.

## Contributing

### Pull request process

CI runs on every PR:

1. `npm ci` — Clean install
2. `npm run format:check` — oxfmt formatting check
3. `npm run lint` — oxlint
4. `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript type checking
5. `npm run test` — Vitest test suite

All checks must pass before merge.

### Bonk (AI code review)

## Boundaries

**Always:**

- Run `npm run check` before considering work done
- Add tests for new functionality
- Consider security implications — this handles API tokens and OAuth flows
- Use Zod for runtime validation of external data

**Ask first:**

- Adding new dependencies
- Changing authentication flows or token handling
- Modifying the OpenAPI spec processing pipeline
- Changing deployment configuration or bindings

**Never:**

- Hardcode secrets or API keys
- Allow user code to access API tokens directly
- Bypass `globalOutbound` network restrictions
- Force push to main
